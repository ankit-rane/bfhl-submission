Built and deployed a REST API with one endpoint that accepts requests with both GET and POST methods. 
POST method endpoint takes in the request (JSON) and returns the following: 
1. Status 
2. User ID 
3. College Email ID 
4. College Roll Number 
5. Array for numbers 
6. Array for alphabets 
7. Array with the highest lowercase alphabet (refer to logic explanation below) 
GET method endpoint doesnâ€™t take any user input, it just returns an operation_code


This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
